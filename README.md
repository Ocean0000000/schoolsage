## Predicting and Visualizing Student Mastery of K-12 Standards for Teachers

**SchoolSage aims to solve the problem of understanding specifically students' academic strengths and weaknesses. The vision and the hope is that teachers will be able to know exactly what a student has mastered and what needs improvement instead of just having a sense of what they know from Day 1 in the classroom.**
